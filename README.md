## **Technologies Used**

- **HTML5**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS3**: Styling with modern features like gradients, flexbox, grid, and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Handles dynamic functionality, including form submissions, modals, and data management.
- **Responsive Design**: Media queries and flexible layouts for cross-device compatibility.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- A modern web browser (e.g., **Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge**).
- No additional dependencies or server setup required, as the app runs entirely in the browser.

### **Installation**
1. **Clone or download** the repository to your local machine.
2. **Open the `index.html` file in a web browser** to run the application.

## **File Structure**

## Usage
1. **Read Posts**:
   - Navigate to the "Read Posts" tab to view all blog posts.
   - Use the search bar to filter posts by title, category, content, or author.
   - Click "Read Full Post" to view a post's full content in a modal.

2. **Create Posts**:
   - Go to the "Create Post" tab.
   - Fill out the form with a title, category, content, and author name.
   - Click "Publish Post" to add the post to the blog list.

3. **Manage Posts**:
   - Switch to the "Manage Posts" tab to view all posts.
   - Click "Edit" to modify a post in a modal form or "Delete" to remove a post (with confirmation).

4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - Press `Escape` to close any open modal.

## Customization
- **Styling**: Modify the CSS in the `<style>` section of `index.html` to change colors, fonts, or layouts.
- **Categories**: Update the `<select>` options in the create/edit forms to add or remove categories.
- **Sample Data**: Edit the `addSampleData` function in the JavaScript to customize the initial blog posts.

## Limitations
- **Storage**: Uses a simple variable (`window.blogStorage`) to simulate localStorage, meaning data is not truly persistent across sessions.
- **No Backend**: The app is frontend-only and does not support server-side storage or user authentication.
- **Single User**: Designed for single-user interaction without multi-user support.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate a backend (e.g., Node.js, Firebase) for persistent storage.
- Add user authentication to manage posts per user.
- Implement advanced search filters (e.g., by date or specific categories).
- Enhance accessibility with ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
- Add support for rich text editing in the content field.
